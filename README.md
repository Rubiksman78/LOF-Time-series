# LOF-Time-series

 Anomaly detection in time series data.
 The method is based on the classic LOF algorithm (Local Outlier Factor) and is described in the following paper:
 
 [1] J. K. P. Selvaraj, “A simple yet effective method for detecting outliers in time series data,” in Proc. of the IEEE Int. Conf. on Data Mining, pp. 1-8, 1999.
 
 It is a clustering method for outlier detection.
 
 To use the code you can launch :
 ```python outlier_detection.py```

 Check `config.py` for the configuration of the model (number of clusters k, threshold, averaging window, etc.)
